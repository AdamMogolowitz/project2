## Meeting notes

## Status check ins

### Check-in 1
Element Names:
- lc_icon
- lc_banner
- lc_scaffold
- lc_card

Proporties:
- Color
- Size
- Margins
- States

Design Considerations:
- Contrast
- Scalibility

Next Steps: We plan to work on getting our individual blog posts and our group check-in 1 done by this Sunday. As well as assign    
            responsibilities to each person on our team.

### Check-in 2
What did you take away from the portion of class about implementing SimpleColors?
- What we took away from the implementation of SimpleColors was that it is already a part of our repo so we just need to implement it. This will allow us to use names that are easier to understand for colors instead of their hex codes. As well as, make it easier for the colors to switch from light and dark modes for us.

What did you learn from other groups?
- We learned that we are in the same boat as other teams, where we are getting started and trying to figure out how to get all the elements to work the way we want them too.

What are your next steps?
- Our next steps are to get the icon to have basic API rendering, as well as the banner having API that supports two name slots and implements the icon.

### Check-in 3
- We tried to do the dynamic import in class, but it wasn't rendering correctly. We couldn't get the header to be a seperate file and then slot it into our NHL card.
- Liz wasn't able to make progress due to hockey games this past weekend, but she will be working on tomorrow morning and plans to post progress tomorrow.
- The next steps are to get everything rendering correctly and then properly format the visuals while making everything reusable. The header / banner should have progress tomorrow. 
### Check-in 4
