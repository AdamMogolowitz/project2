### Meeting Date: 10/19

#### What we did:
We listened to the guest presenter Chuck Lavera walk us through his solution for the card comp project. As well as listening to Bryan critique The Table In The Corner and a few other group's card comps.

- What approaches can you leverage from his example to enhance your team's element?
The approaches our team could leverage from Chuck's example are how he uses CSS variables to handle the color-changing between the different card colors for the different elements of the card. Another approach our team could leverage from Chuck is how he used rendering to get the different parts of the card to work in the ways we need them to while also using slotting.

- How could you take his approach and envision a more flexible version?
Taking Chuck's approach on responsive design for the cards, my team could make it more flexible by using a different method that makes it more granular as Bryan talked about.

#### What we'll do next:
We plan to work on continue working on getting our card to look like the comp as well as take the things we learned from Chuck and the other groups and try to implement them in our project.

### Meeting Date: 10/14

#### What we did:
We listened to Bryan show us SimpleColors so then we don't have to look up the hex code for the colors we want. It also has the accent and dark mode for the colors we pick.

#### What we'll do next:
We plan to work on getting the icon and banner working for this Sunday's check-in.

### Meeting Date: 10/12

#### What we did:
We listened to Bryan give feedback for our project 1 buttons, as well as what performance optimization techniques that we might want to use for our second project. We also worked on getting our started card.

#### What we'll do next:
We plan to work on the two articles we need to read for Thursday, as well as continuing our progress on our card.

### Meeting Date: 10/7

#### What we did:
We listened to Bryan talk about the parts of the project 2 repo, as well as what we needed to write our blog post about. We also worked on the first check in for this project which is located below.

#### What we'll do next:
We plan to work on getting our individual blog posts and our group check-in 1 done by this Sunday. As well as assign responsibilities to each person on our team.

## Status check ins


### Check-in 1
Element Names:
- lc_icon
- lc_banner
- lc_scaffold
- lc_card

Proporties:
- Color
- Size
- Margins
- States

Design Considerations:
- Contrast
- Scalibility

Next Steps: We plan to work on getting our individual blog posts and our group check-in 1 done by this Sunday. As well as assign    
            responsibilities to each person on our team.

### Check-in 2
What did you take away from the portion of class about implementing SimpleColors?
- What we took away from the implementation of SimpleColors was that it is already a part of our repo so we just need to implement it. This will allow us to use names that are easier to understand for colors instead of their hex codes. As well as, make it easier for the colors to switch from light and dark modes for us.

What did you learn from other groups?
- We learned that we are in the same boat as other teams, where we are getting started and trying to figure out how to get all the elements to work the way we want them too.

What are your next steps?
- Our next steps are to get the icon to have basic API rendering, as well as the banner having API that supports two name slots and implements the icon.
